On LYFE is a narrative-driven sci-fi exploration game where you play as the captain of a deep space crew aboard the Light Years Faraway Exploration vessel. 
What begins as a routine mission takes a mind-bending turn when your ship encounters a mysterious wormhole.

Trapped in an unfamiliar dimension, your crewmates vanish, and your surroundings begin to twist in strange, unexplainable ways. 
As you explore the ship and uncover cryptic symbols, surreal phenomena, and hidden truths, you’ll need to piece together the fate of your team—and your own forgotten past.

Immerse yourself in a gripping atmosphere filled with suspense, environmental puzzles, and a universe that refuses to play by the rules.
